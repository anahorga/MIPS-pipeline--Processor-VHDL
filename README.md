# MIPS Pipeline in VHDL  

This project implements a **MIPS pipeline** in **VHDL** with 5 stages:  
- **IF (Instruction Fetch)** – Fetches instructions from memory.  
- **ID (Instruction Decode)** – Decodes instructions and reads registers.  
- **EX (Execute)** – Performs arithmetic and logic operations.  
- **MEM (Memory Access)** – Accesses data memory.  
- **WB (Write Back)** – Writes results back to registers.  

Optimized for efficient instruction execution with basic hazard detection and forwarding.
